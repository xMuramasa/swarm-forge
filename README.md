# SwarmForge

SwarmForge coordinates AI agents in isolated git worktrees and herdr agents.
Agents exchange committed work through durable handoffs, while the operator
uses a local dashboard to start work, inspect agents, handle approval gates,
answer clarifications, and stop the swarm.

This repository's master branch is named `main`. It is the landing page,
installer source, shared runtime, and shared engineering law. It is not itself
a runnable SwarmForge product.

## Products

| Command | Branch | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `get-swarm-forge two-pack` | [`two-pack`](https://github.com/unclebob/swarm-forge/blob/two-pack/README.md) | Pack installed into the current project: `coder` → `cleaner`. |
| `get-swarm-forge four-pack` | [`four-pack`](https://github.com/unclebob/swarm-forge/blob/four-pack/README.md) | Pack installed into the current project: `specifier` → `coder` → `refactorer` → `architect`. |
| `get-swarm-forge six-pack` | [`six-pack`](https://github.com/unclebob/swarm-forge/blob/six-pack/README.md) | Pack installed into the current project: six separate specification, implementation, cleanup, architecture, hardening, and QA roles. |
| `get-swarm-forge project-manager` | [`project-manager`](https://github.com/unclebob/swarm-forge/blob/project-manager/README.md) | Multi-project forge with selectable two-, four-, and six-pack templates and a host lieutenant. |
| `get-swarm-forge lieutenant` | [`lieutenant`](https://github.com/unclebob/swarm-forge/blob/lieutenant/README.md) | Multi-project forge with one configurable project template and a planning lieutenant. |

A **pack** is composed into an existing project. Running `./swarm` starts that
project's configured roles.

A **forge** is installed into an empty host directory. Running `./swarm` starts
the forge dashboard and host lieutenant; project swarms start when the operator
creates or opens projects beneath `projects/`.

The `squad`, `sprint-module-squad`, and `adversaries` branches are separate
experimental workflows. They are not `get-swarm-forge` products.

## Prerequisites

- `zsh`
- `git`
- [`herdr`](https://herdr.dev/), running (the operator watches the swarm in its TUI)
- Babashka (`bb`)
- At least one configured agent backend: `grok`, `codex`, `claude`, or
  `copilot`

## Install the helper

Put `get-swarm-forge` somewhere on `PATH`:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/cmds
curl -L -o ~/cmds/get-swarm-forge \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unclebob/swarm-forge/main/get-swarm-forge
chmod +x ~/cmds/get-swarm-forge
```

Add `~/cmds` to `PATH`, then recopy the helper when it changes. The helper is
the supported entry point because it composes files from more than one branch.

## Composition

For a pack install, the helper downloads two branches:

```text
main
  swarmforge/scripts/                    shared runtime and dashboard
  swarmforge/constitution/articles/      shared engineering, workflow, handoffs

<pack branch>
  swarm                                  launcher
  swarmforge/swarmforge.conf             roles, agents, and worktrees
  swarmforge/constitution.prompt         constitution entry point
  swarmforge/constitution/articles/      pack-local additions
  swarmforge/roles/                       role ownership
```

The result is written into the current project. Shared article names
`engineering.prompt`, `workflow.prompt`, and `handoffs.prompt` always come from
`main`; a pack specializes them with `project.prompt` and `local-*.prompt`
files.

For a forge install, the named forge branch supplies the host runtime,
lieutenant, and dashboard. `project-manager` also downloads the three pack
branches into `packs/`; `lieutenant` carries its one template under
`.swarmforge/project-pack/`.

## Accounts

A project runs on one billing account, chosen per project rather than per role.
Accounts live in `~/.config/swarmforge/accounts.conf`, one line each, naming
the config directory of every backend that account uses:

```text
account personal claude=~/.claude-personal
account work     claude=~/.claude codex=~/.codex
```

The project picks one with a line in `swarmforge/swarmforge.conf`:

```text
account personal
```

`SWARMFORGE_ACCOUNT=work ./swarm` overrides it for one run. Every agent in the
project starts with that account's directory (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` for Claude,
`CODEX_HOME` for Codex), and Codex trust is recorded there. Startup stops with
a reason if the account is unknown, lacks a directory for a backend a role
uses, or the directory does not exist (log in there once first). With no
account selected, agents inherit the environment of the herdr pane, which is
usually your default account.

## Configuration contract

Every running project has a `swarmforge/swarmforge.conf`. For the fixed packs,
each non-comment line has this shape:

```text
window[-invisible] <role> <backend> <worktree> [task|batch] [forward-only|back-one|back-all] [backend arguments...]
```

- File order is the default forward pipeline. Exactly one role must use the
  `master` worktree; that sentinel means the project's main checkout on its
  current branch. Other names become `.worktrees/<name>` checkouts.
- `window` and `window-invisible` both start the role as a herdr agent in its own
  pane of the project's workspace (two rows, roles filled in file order); the two
  spellings are kept for old configs.
- Receive mode defaults to `task`. `batch` lets a role accept a compatible
  group of queued handoffs together.
- Propagation defaults to `forward-only`. `back-one` and `back-all` arrange
  merge-only copies for earlier roles after downstream work.
- Supported backends are `codex`, `grok`, `claude`, and `copilot`; remaining
  tokens are passed to that backend.

Forge hosts instead use `Lieutenant <backend> [backend arguments...]`.
Branches may extend the grammar for their own control plane—for example,
`lieutenant` adds typed `card` routes and the squad branches add
`swarmforge/squad.conf`. The selected branch README and its parser are the
authority for those extensions.

## Constitution and role prompts

The installer composes instructions as data; it does not bake every product's
rules into the launcher. A normal pack agent is started with instructions to
read `swarmforge/constitution.prompt`, recursively read what it names, and then
read `swarmforge/roles/<role>.prompt`.

The three article names owned by `main` are:

| Article | Shared responsibility |
|---|---|
| [`engineering.prompt`](swarmforge/constitution/articles/engineering.prompt) | Language defaults, testability, acceptance-pipeline tooling, verification, and quality-tool guardrails. |
| [`workflow.prompt`](swarmforge/constitution/articles/workflow.prompt) | Worktree discipline, commit attribution, temporary files, and failure conditions. |
| [`handoffs.prompt`](swarmforge/constitution/articles/handoffs.prompt) | The structured send, receive, merge, retry, and completion protocol. |

A product branch contributes its constitution entry point and any differently
named local articles, such as `project.prompt`, `local-engineering.prompt`, or
`local-workflow.prompt`. The composer reserves the three shared names above for
`main`, so a pack cannot silently replace common law. The product's README
describes what its local articles add without repeating these shared rules.

Role prompts divide ownership inside that law: what a role may change, what it
must verify, what it must leave to another role, and where its next handoff
goes. There must be a matching prompt for every configured role. A forge
lieutenant is the exception: the shared
[`lieutenant.prompt`](swarmforge/roles/lieutenant.prompt) explicitly keeps it
outside the project engineering constitution.

## Use a product

Install a pack in an existing software repository:

```sh
get-swarm-forge six-pack
./swarm
```

Or install a forge in an empty directory:

```sh
get-swarm-forge lieutenant
./swarm
```

The selected product's README describes its routes, roles, worktrees, project
lifecycle, and dashboard behavior. The branch configuration—not this README—is
the authority for current backend assignments and topology.

## What `main` owns

```text
get-swarm-forge                         product composer
swarmforge/scripts/                    launcher, dashboard, board, handoffs
swarmforge/constitution/articles/      shared agent rules
swarmforge/handoff-protocol.md         durable handoff protocol
test/                                  shared runtime tests
```

Changes to shared launch, dashboard, terminal, worktree, board, or handoff
behavior belong on `main` first. Pack branches own only their configuration,
local constitution additions, role prompts, and launcher. Forge branches carry
the common files needed for standalone installation and should be refreshed
from `main` when those files change.

Do not pin prompt prose with automated tests. Test observable runtime behavior
instead.

## Runtime components and generated state

The shared runtime is divided by responsibility:

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `swarmforge.sh` / `swarmforge.bb` | Parse configuration, create worktrees, synchronize managed files, and launch herdr agents. |
| `swarm_handoff.*`, `ready_for_next.*`, `done_with_current.*` | Create, accept, merge, audit, and complete durable work items. |
| `handoffd.*` | Deliver queued handoffs and notify receiving sessions. |
| `pack_board.*`, `pack_web.*`, `pack/dashboard.html` | Persist and present cards, approvals, clarifications, agent panes, and controls. |
| `forge.*` | Create, open, refresh, and stop projects inside a forge product. |
| `herdr.bb` | The one wrapper over the herdr CLI: workspaces, panes, agents, prompts, reads. |
| `close-swarm` | Archive role panes, stop the daemon, and close the project's herdr workspace. |

At startup the composed runtime validates the configuration, initializes git
when necessary, creates role worktrees, mirrors the managed SwarmForge files
into them, starts the handoff daemon and local dashboard, and launches each
configured agent backend in its own pane of a per-project herdr workspace,
tiled in a grid.

`master` in a role configuration means the project's main checkout on its
current branch; it is a worktree sentinel, not a required git branch name.
Generated transport and process state lives under `.swarmforge/`; generated
role checkouts live under `.worktrees/`. `.swarmforge/` contains such runtime
records as role/agent maps, the herdr workspace id, handoff inboxes and outboxes,
board data, approvals, clarifications, daemon state, and dashboard state. It is
not product source and agents must not edit it as a substitute for the helper
commands.

Agents send committed work with `swarm_handoff.sh`, accept it with
`ready_for_next.sh`, and finish the current item with `done_with_current.sh`.
See [the handoff protocol](swarmforge/handoff-protocol.md) for message format,
auditing, delivery, retry, merge, and lifecycle details.

The `simple-windows` tag marks the last `main` snapshot before the dashboard
cockpit. It is historical and is not a `get-swarm-forge` product.
